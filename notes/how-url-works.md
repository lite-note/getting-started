# How Lite Note's URLs work

Notes are identified by their "[SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms)", this identifier is unique per note AND also by their [revision](./note-revision.md).

Therefor, when you share an URL, you'll be assure that everyone will see the same note you wanted to share, even after the note was updated.

**Attention**: the homepage of note will always be the latest README file in the repository, so the links in it will be updated to the latest version.
