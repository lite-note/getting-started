# 🖋 Taking notes with Lite Note

## 👆🏽 README.md is the main file

Your notes must start with a README.md file. Lite note will display this first note as the homepage.

## ✨ There are special folders

Before having beautiful notes, we create first fleeting notes and drafts. We can put them in [inbox](https://litenote.space/lite-note/getting-started/inbox) and `drafts` folders. We can access later from the header in Lite Note.
