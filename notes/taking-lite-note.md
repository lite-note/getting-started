# 🖋 Taking notes with Lite Note

## 👆🏽 README.md is the main file

Your notes must start with a README.md file. Lite note will display this first note as the homepage.

## ✨ There are special folders

Before having beautiful notes, we create first fleeting notes and drafts but because these notes are not yet in our note flow, we can't have access to them.

So Lite Note has 2 special folders:
- [fleeting-notes](https://litenote.space/lite-note/getting-started/fleeting-notes)
- [drafts](https://litenote.space/lite-note/getting-started/drafts)

They are available in the header.
