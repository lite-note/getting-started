# 📝 What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.
> Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

Indeed, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files are easy to write and is ideal for atomic notes.

# What can we do in Markdown?

Emphased texts, bold texts, headers, lists, task lists, images, tables, quotes, codes. We have all we need to organise our notes.
