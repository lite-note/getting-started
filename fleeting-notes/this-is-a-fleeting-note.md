# This is a fleeting note

Fleeting note is where everything begins. Capture your thoughts and write it down. List of ideas, lack of context or just one line useful. No worries, the goal to fleeting notes is to save your process of thinking.

The next steps are to organize your notes to an [atomic level](../notes/atomic-notes.md) in the [draft folder](../drafts/note-quite-ready.md) or to delete them if there is no relevant content. The goal is to have a routine to make sure the folder is as small as possible.

You may want to title your notes with the day's date: `2021-03-21.md`.
