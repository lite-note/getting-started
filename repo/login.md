# Login with GitHub

To be able to see your private repositories, you must login and create a **Personal Access Token**. GitHub has a [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) if you want more information.

With your username and your Personal Access Token, you can now save them in [Lite Note](https://lite-note.space/login)
